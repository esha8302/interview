Q.1) Print the maximum occuring character in string.

s = 'samples worddd'
counts = {}
# creating hash map for character counts
for i in s:
    if i in counts.keys():
        counts[i] += 1
    else:
        counts[i] = 1
        
max_count = 0

ans = ''
# maximum occuring char
for i in counts:
    if counts[i] > max_count:
        max_count = counts[i]
        ans = i

print(ans)


Q.2) Print the first non-repeating character in the string.

s = 'samples worddd'
counts = {}
# creating hash map for character counts
for i in s:
    if i in counts.keys():
        counts[i] += 1
    else:
        counts[i] = 1
#non repeating character
for i in counts:
    if counts[i] == 1:
        print(i)
        break
